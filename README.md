# OpenCore-Legion-5i-17IMH05H
 
This repository contains EFI files for OpenCore 0.6.7 for Legion-5i-17IMH05H with macOS Big Sur 11.2.3

This is the main guide I follow: [OpenCore Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/)

Note: The commit descriptions are inaccurate since all the files are uploaded at the same time.

Note: This repo contains extra properties files added by Mac. (.DS_STORE, .\__filename_ etc)
